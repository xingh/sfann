I - About this program
----------------------

This program is a command-line tool that provides an easy way of learning, testing and running artificial neural networks (ANN). It uses the Fast Artificial Neural Network library (FANN) for learning and testing.

An artificial neural network (ANN), usually called "neural network" (NN), is a mathematical model or computational model that tries to simulate the structure and/or functional aspects of biological neural networks. An ANN performs a non-parametric non-linear multivariate multiple regression.

The Fast Artificial Neural Network library (FANN) is a free open source neural network library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C and supports both fully and sparsely connected networks. Cross-platform execution in both fixed and floating point is supported. It includes a framework for easy handling of training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well documented, and fast. PHP, C++, .NET, Ada, Python, Delphi, Octave, Ruby, Prolog Pure Data and Mathematica bindings are available.


II - Features
-------------

The main features of this program are :

    * Automatic cross-validation evaluation
    * Auto-saving of ANN that performs the best on train, dev or test



III - Installation
------------------

1) The program requires external libraries :
   * fann, available at http://leenissen.dk/fann/
   * boost (program_option), available at http://www.boost.org/

2) compile the program:

   ./configure
   make

3) place the binary in your path:

   cp src/sfann what/ever/you/want

4) suppress the compiled files:

   make clean



III - Changelog
---------------

  v0.1
  ----
    * initial release
